# Cloudcast

Cloudcast is my first step into the iOS Development world with a project that was made alongside participating in CodePath's Intro to iOS Development. Essentially Cloudcast is a weather App that shows the forecast for a certain location, using real data from Open-Meteo API. The project itself was split into two different parts

- The first part of the project consisted of setting up the `ForeCastViewcontroller` to hold all of the logic for our app as well as linking the viewcontroller to to the View Controller that created in Storyboard. After creating and Linking the UI elements to code, we created a data model in `WeatherForecast.swift` and configured our UI elements to dynamically display the properties of our WeatherForecast data model. 

- In the second part of the Project, we used Postman to create requests and inspect responses. In order to fetch data from the Open-Meteo API, we had to use the URLsession library in order to create a network request. Then, we Transformed responses from serialized data and deserialized them into data models.

## Lessons Learned

This was my first project stepping into the world of Mobile development using iOS and even though CloudCast is considered an beginner level project, I did find myself struggling to understand a lot of concepts. For example, I was confused on how we used the URLSession library in order to create the network request to fetch data from the Open-Meteo API. While I still don't fully understand it, it is going to take time to learn all of the syntax of Swift.
